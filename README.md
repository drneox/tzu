<img src="tzu.png" alt="TZU Logo" width="200">

An AI-powered comprehensive web application designed to help identify threats and manage action plans, following industry cybersecurity standards including OWASP Risk Rating, STRIDE, OWASP ASVS/MASVS.

## ü§î Why TZU?

**TZU** is inspired by **Sun Tzu**, the Chinese military strategist and philosopher, author of *‚ÄúThe Art of War,‚Äù* one of the most influential works on strategy and tactics.


> ‚ÄúVictorious warriors win first and then go to war; defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.‚Äù ‚Äî Sun Tzu


Just as Sun Tzu emphasizes knowing the enemy ‚Äî and knowing yourself ‚Äî to achieve victory, TZU empowers cybersecurity teams to:

- üß≠ **Know Yourself:** Inventory assets and data; identify crown jewels; map trust boundaries and data flows.
- üéØ **Profile Adversaries:** Capture skill, motive, opportunity/exposure, and size.  
  _OWASP RR ‚Üí populates **Threat Agent Factors**, driving **Likelihood**._
- üîç **Know Your Threats:** Derive threats from **architecture/DFD diagrams** and **use cases**, supported by AI-assisted analysis.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Know Your Defenses:** Assess your current posture and **vulnerabilities**; map **controls** to **OWASP ASVS/MASVS**.
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Strategic Planning:** Define **mitigation plans prioritized by risk level**; apply a **consistent risk model (Likelihood √ó Impact)** to **calculate and track** **inherent, current, and residual risk**.










In cybersecurity‚Äîas in ancient warfare‚Äî**preparation and intelligence make the difference**. TZU delivers the tools and traceability to stay ahead of threats and protect your digital assets by applying Sun Tzu‚Äôs strategic wisdom to modern security challenges.




## üöÄ Quick Start

### üê≥ Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The fastest way to get TZU running is with our automated setup script:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/drneox/tzu
cd tzu

# 2. Configure environment (optional but recommended)
# Edit .env file to add your API key and timezone
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and configure:
# - Choose ONE AI provider (not both):
#   * OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here OR
#   * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
# - TZ=your_timezone (e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London, America/Lima)

# 3. Run the automated setup script
./start.sh
```

The script will automatically:
- üîß Build and start all services (nginx, backend, postgresql)
- üîê Generate secure admin credentials
- üìã Display access information

**‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Notes:**
- **AI Features**: Choose ONE AI provider - either OpenAI OR Anthropic API key (not both)
- **Timezone**: Set your local timezone for accurate timestamps in reports and logs

**Access the application:**
- **Web App**: http://localhost:3434
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:3434/api/docs
- **Credentials**: Displayed after setup completion


## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **AI-Powered Threat Identification**: Intelligent threat detection and analysis capabilities
- **Action Plan Management**: Comprehensive management of security action plans and remediation strategies
- **OWASP Risk Rating**: Complete implementation for risk level categorization with threat agent factors, vulnerability factors, and impact calculations
- **Industry Standards Compliance**: Built following OWASP Risk Rating, STRIDE, OWASP ASVS, and MASVS cybersecurity standards
- **Threat Modeling**: Interactive diagram upload and threat identification
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated calculation of likelihood and impact scores to determine risk levels

## üîê Authentication & Security

### Default Credentials
After deployment, generate secure credentials:

```bash
docker exec docker-backend-1 python show_credentials.py
```

This will display:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: Auto-generated secure password

### Supported Cybersecurity Standards

- **OWASP Risk Rating**: Complete methodology for risk level categorization and assessment
- **STRIDE**: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege threat categorization
- **OWASP ASVS**: Application Security Verification Standard for comprehensive security requirements coverage
- **OWASP MASVS**: Mobile Application Security Verification Standard for mobile security assessment and security recommendations generation

### Risk Assessment Process

The OWASP Risk Rating methodology categorizes risk levels by evaluating factors across four dimensions:

### Threat Agent Factors
- **Skill Level**: How technically skilled is this group of threat agents?
- **Motive**: How motivated is this group of threat agents to find and exploit this vulnerability?
- **Opportunity**: What resources and opportunities are required for this group of threat agents to find and exploit this vulnerability?
- **Size**: How large is this group of threat agents?

### Vulnerability Factors
- **Ease of Discovery**: How easy is it for this group of threat agents to discover this vulnerability?
- **Ease of Exploit**: How easy is it for this group of threat agents to actually exploit this vulnerability?
- **Awareness**: How well known is this vulnerability to this group of threat agents?
- **Intrusion Detection**: How likely is an exploit to be detected?

### Technical Impact
- **Loss of Confidentiality**: How much data could be disclosed and how sensitive is it?
- **Loss of Integrity**: How much data could be corrupted and how damaged is it?
- **Loss of Availability**: How much service could be lost and how vital is it?
- **Loss of Accountability**: Are the threat agents' actions traceable to an individual?

### Business Impact
- **Financial Damage**: How much financial damage will result from an exploit?
- **Reputation Damage**: Would an exploit result in reputation damage that would harm the business?
- **Non-Compliance**: How much exposure does this create for non-compliance with regulations?
- **Privacy Violation**: How much personally identifiable information could be disclosed?
